### Interested in **Ruby**?
**[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)** is created by **Yukihiro Matsumoto** in about year 1995. According to its creator, Ruby was influenced by **Perl**, **Smalltalk**, **Eiffel**, **Ada**, and **Lisp**. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.

The author of this blog will share and record the experience in Ruby Language programming in this section. }) %><br> <%= link_to view_button("Ruby Programming"), ruby_discussions_path, :class => "btn pull-right btn-index" %></div>

### Welcome Abroad! 
#### **You are riding [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails)!**

Since about ten years ago, **David Heinemeier Hansson** created this marvelous web framework which follows the rule of **Model-View-Controller**(**[MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller)**). 

It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as **JSON** or **XML** for data transfer, and **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** for display and user interfacing. 

In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including **convention over configuration (CoC)**, **don't repeat yourself (DRY)**, and the **active record pattern**.
